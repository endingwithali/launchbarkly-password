This server is to exclusively check the status of the LaunchBarkly password hashing flag. It is to be used in tandem with the [LaunchBarkly](https://github.com/endingwithali/launchbarkly) product.


## Setup

You will need to sign up for an account with [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/), and create a feature flag called `launchbarkly-password` with a feature flag key named `launchbarkly`. 

### Hosting

This will need to be hosted - the production version utilizes [Heroku](https://heroku.com). You can learn more about deploying on Heroku [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/nodejs-support). 

### ENV Vars
Create a file `.env` in `/`, and fill in with the relevant information:

```Javascript
LD_PROD_KEY='{production SDK key generated by LaunchDarkly}'
```

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install the packages, and run the development server:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result, which will display a returned JSON object.

### Caveat
Must use at minimum node 13.14.0 or there will be errors upon launching. 


## Why the Separate Server for the LaunchDarkly calls

The main project project is a [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) based project.

By design, Next.js relies upon server-side rendering of the content - making it difficult to integrate LaunchDarkly. Options explored involved removing the features that enable Next.JS and it's easy integration into Vercel. I opted for rapid prototyping, and chose to implement a server that could respond to a client side focused implementation.
